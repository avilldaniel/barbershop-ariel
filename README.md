# 💈 Barbershop Business Landing Page

## 📝 Overview

A landing page for a local barber! A big focus for me when building
this project was design and responsiveness. With a mobile-first
design pattern, my goal was to make sure the site was smooth on
mobile devices, whilst also making sure the app did not break when
scaling to larger viewports. My favorite part of the project was
creating the navigation bar through vanilla CSS. It also includes a
contact section, allowing visitors to send a message which will then
be re-directed to the business owner's email inbox.
